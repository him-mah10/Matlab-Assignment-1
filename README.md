This repository contains solutions to Matlab Assignment 1 for DSAA course at IIIT Hyderabad. Report contain details of algorithm implementation, results and observations and answers to the subjective questions (if any).

#### Questions:
1) As we all know youtube has a speed increase and speed decrease button. When it is done for the sound we call it as either time stretching or speed reading. Now the task is to take your audio signal, increase and decrease the speed of signal by 2 times. Plot the signal andanalyze the differences. (Note: Frequency of signal has to be constant)
2) The Problem has 3 parts:
 	1) Read a wav file in MATLAB. It is originally sampled at 44.1kHz and has digitized at 24 bits. Play the sound. Also, record your own voice for this question.
	2) Subsample to 24kHz, 16kHz, 8kHz and 4kHz. Play the sound.
	3) Simulate it in three different environments using the concepts and examples considered
in the class. You can download impulse response characterizing the system (environ-
ment) from the internet.
3) Write a code in Matlab to spot the face given in F1.jpg inside the image Faces.jpg. Comment
on whether your above approach would work if Faces.jpg is noisy. How would you modify
your approach to incorporate noisy images like F2.jpg?
4) Kishan is developing a software for image processing tools. While making it he got into
a problem of resizing the image and comes to you for help. You have to make a function
RESIZE which enlarges an image by a given extent. RESIZE takes two arguments A
(Image matrix) and X (times the original image should be resized) (X is always a positive
integer). It should return an image matrix B of the desired size. Resizing can be done using
interpolation. Try to implement the above using:
	1) Nearest Neighbour Interpolation
	2) Bilinear Interpolation
Test your code on the following cases: 1) X = 5, 2) X = 10
5) You have to read the file sa re ga ma.mp3 from the src directory. You can denoise it using
smoothdata try various params and report the result that which method gave the best result
and why?

#### Cheers!!!
